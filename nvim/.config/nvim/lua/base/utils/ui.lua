--- ### Nvim UI toggle functions
--
--  DESCRIPTION:
--  We use this for easy UI toggles.
--  We call these functions in ../4-mappings.lua and ./lsp.lua
--
--  While you could technically delete this file, we encourage you
--  to keep it as it takes a lot of complexity out of
--  ../4-mappings.lua and ./lsp.lua

local M = {}
local notify = require("base.utils.actions").notify

return M
